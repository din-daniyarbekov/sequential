1. Index.html - "Sign-in"<br/>
     You can sign-in by using both User and Admin profile. <br/>
     In order to sign-in as a User, use "user@mail.com" for the email and "12345" for the password.<br/>
     In order to sign-in as an Admin, use "admin@mail.com" for the email and "6789" for the password.<br/>
 
     After hitting up the "Submit button", you will be redirected to your task page. <br/>
     Based on the information retrieved from the database, you will be either shown "user view" or "admin view"<br/>
 
 
     If you haven't registered yet, you will be able to do so by clicking the "Register" button on the bottom of the form.<br/>
 
 2. Account-creation.html - "Registration"<br/>

     You're given the form, where you can fill out all the necessary information in order to get registered such as: email,
     password and the preference for being admin or user<br/>
     In the next phase, your information will be saved to the database.<br/>

3. user_view.html - Tasks and Task creation 

     Here the user will be able to view all of the tasks they have been assigned or have assigned to themselves. You can view the
     the sorted tasks that are marked as "blockers" which impede progress, and the ones that are finished. When creating a task you
     will only be able to assign yourself to work on it, due to the limited permissions non admin's have.
     
4. admin_view.html -Tasks, and task assignment

     The admin has the extra privilege of assigning anyone in the database to work on a task they created, and also create 
     projects. Projects are just a list of tasks, which also have to have a due date. 
    
    
5. projection_creation.html - Projection
     Project creation just requires the name of the project, and the estimated completion date. We expect to improve the time
     function down to hour measurements, along with many other user interface improvements and extra admin functionality.

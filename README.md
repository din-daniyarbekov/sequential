Note: Account data is not being saved for this phase, therefore everytime you are at the login page you must create a profile.<br>

1. Index.html - "Sign-in"<br />

    You can view both admin and basic user views by creating different accounts. <br />

    After hitting up the "Submit button", you will be redirected to your task page. <br />
    Based on the information retrieved from the database, you will be either shown "user view" or "admin view"<br />


    If you haven't registered yet, you will be able to do so by clicking the "Register" button on the bottom of the form.<br />

2. Account-creation.html - "Registration"<br />

    You're given the form, where you can fill out all the necessary information in order to get registered such as: email,password and the     preference for being admin or user<br />
    
    Once registered, your information will be saved to the database<br />

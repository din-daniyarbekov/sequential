A new account can also be created by clicking "create a new profile" on the login page 

Changes we have made since the previous phase include:
  adding a task search feature
  changing the interface to use modal pop up windows for information entry, which can be dismissed by pressing esc
  added a time indicator to each task, displaying how much time is left before it is due
  added email notifications for multiple features:
    - if a change is made to a tasks blocked or done indicators, an email is sent to the admin of that project
    - if a user creates a task for themselves the admin for that project is emailed
    - if an admin creates a task for a specific user, that user is emailed
    - email also offers a link for user to register if they do not have an account on the website

Differences from original project proposal include:
  removed the project_creation.html to limit the number of unnecessary views, replacing it with a modal pop up
  limited the amount of users assigned to a task to 1 (there still can be any number of users associated with a project)
  limited the number of admins assigned to project to 1
  tasks do not have an estimated time to complete
  admins do not have to authorize admin actions by re-entering their password
  admins cannot change other users profile settings
  admins cannot assign tasks to themselves
  admins cannot change any task to be done or blocked, only people assigned to the task can modify their status
  

Basic User Features:

  Create a task  for yourself - clicking the "Create a task" button and entering the task name, due date, priority in a pop up modal
  (the user that creates a task will trigger a email notification which is sent to the admin of that project) 
  Mark tasks as complete or blocked - clicking the done or blocker buttons located in the task box, clicking the done or blocker button again will remove the complete or blocked flag.
